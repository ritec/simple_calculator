The following Rails app is a simple calculator
The calculator implements the following operators: +, -, /,* on any number of integer arguments.
* There are controller tests
* I could have used the eval method but decided to use the String calculate method from [Theo Dorton](https://github.com/theodorton/ruby-string-calculate) as it is safer. I did however still add a method to check for valid input in the text box.

Thanks!
